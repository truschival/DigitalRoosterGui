# Graphical User Interface

Here are screenshots and references to interactive widgets.
Items that have a context menu are activated by *press-and-hold*
for a second. Others are directly clickable.
I recommend you just figure it out and find the bugs!

Here are some hints:

## Main page


*   Sleep timer - remaining time until going to standby.
    *click* resets the timer
    *press-and-hold* opens the sleep-timer context menu.


## Podcasts

*press-and-hold* activates the context menu to update the podcasts

## Alarms

*press-and-hold* activates the context menu to update the alarm


## Radios
No interaction except for playing...
